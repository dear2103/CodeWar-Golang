## **Ex2**
[Multiplication table for number](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/MultiplicationTableForNumber.go)
> Your goal is to return multiplication table for **number** that is always an integer from 1 to 10.
> For example, a multiplication table (string) for **number == 5** looks like below:
1. 1 * 5 = 5
1. 2 * 5 = 10
1. 3 * 5 = 15
1. 4 * 5 = 20
1. 5 * 5 = 25
1. 6 * 5 = 30
1. 7 * 5 = 35
1. 8 * 5 = 40
1. 9 * 5 = 45
1. 10 * 5 = 50
> P.S You can use **\n** in string to jump to the next line.
## **Ex3**
[Quarter of the year](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/QuarterOfTheYear.go)
> Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

> For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.
## **Ex4**
[Returning Strings](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ReturningStrings.go)
> Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, **"Hello, <name> how are you doing today?"**
> [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]
## **Ex5**
[Return Negative](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ReturnNegative.go)
> In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
> Example:
1. MakeNegative(1)    # return -1
1. MakeNegative(-5)   # return -5
1. MakeNegative(0)    # return 0
> **Notes:**
1. The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
1. Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
## **Ex6**
[Remove First and Last Character](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/RemoveFirstAndLastCharacter.go)
> It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
## **Ex7**
[String repeat](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/StringRepeat.go)
> repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
> repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"
