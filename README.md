[Multiplication table for number <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/MultiplicationTableForNumber.go)
Your goal is to return multiplication table for **number** that is always an integer from 1 to 10. 
> For example, a multiplication table (string) for **number == 5** looks like below:
- 1 * 5 = 5
- 2 * 5 = 10
- 3 * 5 = 15
- 4 * 5 = 20
- 5 * 5 = 25
- 6 * 5 = 30
- 7 * 5 = 35
- 8 * 5 = 40
- 9 * 5 = 45
- 10 * 5 = 50
> P.S You can use **\n** in string to jump to the next line.
## Ex3
[Quarter of the year <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/QuarterOfTheYear.go)
Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.
> For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.
## Ex4
[Returning Strings <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ReturningStrings.go)
Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, **"Hello, <name> how are you doing today?"**
> [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]
## Ex5
[Return Negative <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ReturnNegative.go)
In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
> Example:
- MakeNegative(1)    # return -1
- MakeNegative(-5)   # return -5
- MakeNegative(0)    # return 0
> Notes:
1. The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
1. Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
## Ex6
[Remove First and Last Character <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/RemoveFirstAndLastCharacter.go)
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
## Ex7
[String repeat <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/StringRepeat.go)
- repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
- repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

## Ex9
[Twice as old <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/TwiceAsOld.go)
Your function takes two arguments:
1. current father's age (years)
2. current age of his son (years)
Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
## Ex10
[Abbreviate a Two Word Name <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/AbbreviateATwoWordName.go)
Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.
> It should look like this:
- Sam Harris => S.H
- Patrick Feeney => P.F
## Ex11
[MakeUpperCase <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/MakeUpperCase.go)

[You Can't Code Under Pressure #1 <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/YouCan'tCodeUnderPressure%231.go)
Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.
## Ex13
[Get Nth Even Number <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/GetNthEvenNumber.go)
Return the Nth Even Number
> Example(Input --> Output)
- 1 --> 0 (the first even number is 0)
- 3 --> 4 (the 3rd even number is 4 (0, 2, 4))
- 100 --> 198
- 1298734 --> 2597466
## Ex14
[DNA to RNA Conversion <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/DNAtoRNAConversion.go)
Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T'). Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U'). Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
> For example:
- "GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of **'G'**, **'C'**, **'A'** and/or **'T'**.
## Ex15
[Grasshopper - Terminal game move function <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/Grasshopper-TerminalGameMoveFunction.go)
Terminal game move function. In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the die and moves the number of spaces indicated by the die two times. Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
> Example:
- move(3, 6) should equal 15
## Ex16
[Is this a triangle? <7kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/IsThisATriangle.go)
Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case. (In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
## Ex17
[Breaking chocolate problem <7kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/BreakingChocolateProblem.go)
Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.
> For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks. If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.
## Ex18
[Make a function that does arithmetic! <7kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/MakeAFunctionThatDoesArithmetic.go)
Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them. **a** and **b** will both be positive integers, and **a** will always be the first number in the operation, and **b** always the second. The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".
> A few examples:
- Arithmetic(5, 2, "add")      => returns 7
- Arithmetic(5, 2, "subtract") => returns 3
- Arithmetic(5, 2, "multiply") => returns 10
- Arithmetic(5, 2, "divide")   => returns 2
  > Try to do it without using if statements!
## Ex19
[Over The Road <7kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/OverTheRoad.go) 
> Task
You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. The street looks something like this:
- 1|   |6
- 3|   |4
- 5|   |2
Evens increase on the right; odds decrease on the left. House numbers start at 1 and increase without gaps. When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2.
> Example
Given your house number address and length of street n, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.
> func OverTheRoad(address int, n int) int
- OverTheRoad(1, 3) = 6
- OverTheRoad(3, 3) = 4
- OverTheRoad(2, 3) = 5
- OverTheRoad(3, 5) = 8
> Note about errors
If you are timing out, running out of memory, or get any kind of "error", read on. Both n and address could get upto 500 billion with over 200 random tests. If you try to store the addresses of 500 billion houses in a list then you will run out of memory and the tests will crash. This is not a kata problem so please don't post an issue. Similarly if the tests don't complete within 12 seconds then you also fail.
> To solve this, you need to think of a way to do the kata without making massive lists or huge for loops. Read the discourse for some inspiration :)
## Ex20
[Complementary DNA <7kyu>](https://github.com/dear2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ComplementaryDNA.go)
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
> If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols **"A"** and **"T"** are complements of each other, as **"C"** and **"G"**. You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

> More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

Example: (input: output)
- DNA_strand ("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"
- DNA_strand ("GTAT") # return "CATA"
## Ex21 
  [Multiples of 3 or 5 <6kyu>](https://github.com/dear2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/MultiplesOf3Or5.go)
  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.
> Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)

  ## Ex22
  [Find the odd int <6kyu>](https://github.com/dear2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/FindTheOddInt.go)
  Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times. There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
## Ex23
  [Split Strings <6kyu>](https://github.com/dear2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/SplitStrings.go)
  Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

> Examples:
 - Solution("abc") //should return ["ab", "c_"]
- Solution("abcdef") //should return ["ab", "cd", "ef"]
  ## Ex24
  [IP Validation <6kyu>](https://github.com/dear2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/IPValidation.go)
  Write an algorithm that will identify valid IPv4 addresses in dot-decimal format. IPs should be considered valid if they consist of four octets, with values between **0** and **255**, inclusive.

> Valid inputs examples:
- 1.2.3.4
- 123.45.67.89
> Invalid inputs examples:
- 1.2.3
- 1.2.3.4.5
- 123.456.78.90
- 123.045.067.089
> Notes:
- Leading zeros (e.g. 01.02.03.04) are considered invalid
- Inputs are guaranteed to be a single string
  ## Ex25
  [ISBN-10 Validation <5kyu>](https://github.com/dear2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ISBN-10Validation.go)
ISBN-10 identifiers are ten digits long. The first nine characters are digits **0-9**. The last digit can be **0-9** or **X**, to indicate a value of **10**.
An ISBN-10 number is valid if the sum of the digits multiplied by their position modulo 11 equals zero.
  > For example:
- ISBN     : 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3  9
- position : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
> This is a valid ISBN, because:
(1*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 + 2*4 + 2*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 3*8 + 3*9 + 9*10) % 11 = 0
> Examples
- 1112223339   -->  true
- 111222333    -->  false
- 1112223339X  -->  false
- 1234554321   -->  true
- 1234512345   -->  false
- 048665088X   -->  true
- X123456788   -->  false
