## Ex2
[Multiplication table for number <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/MultiplicationTableForNumber.go)
> Your goal is to return multiplication table for **number** that is always an integer from 1 to 10.
> For example, a multiplication table (string) for **number == 5** looks like below:
1. 1 * 5 = 5
1. 2 * 5 = 10
1. 3 * 5 = 15
1. 4 * 5 = 20
1. 5 * 5 = 25
1. 6 * 5 = 30
1. 7 * 5 = 35
1. 8 * 5 = 40
1. 9 * 5 = 45
1. 10 * 5 = 50
> P.S You can use **\n** in string to jump to the next line.
## Ex3
[Quarter of the year <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/QuarterOfTheYear.go)
> Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

> For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.
## Ex4
[Returning Strings <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ReturningStrings.go)
> Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, **"Hello, <name> how are you doing today?"**
> [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]
## Ex5
[Return Negative <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ReturnNegative.go)
> In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
> Example:
1. MakeNegative(1)    # return -1
1. MakeNegative(-5)   # return -5
1. MakeNegative(0)    # return 0
> **Notes:**
1. The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
1. Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
## Ex6
[Remove First and Last Character <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/RemoveFirstAndLastCharacter.go)
> It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
## Ex7
[String repeat <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/StringRepeat.go)
> repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
> repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"
  ## Ex8
  [Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'. <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/ConvertBooleanValuesToStringsYesOrNo.go)
  > Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a **"Yes"** string for **true**, or a **"No"** string for **false**.
  ## Ex9
  [Twice as old <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/TwiceAsOld.go)
  > Your function takes two arguments:
1. current father's age (years)
2. current age of his son (years)
> Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
  ## Ex10
  [Abbreviate a Two Word Name <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/AbbreviateATwoWordName.go)
  > Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
> The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

> It should look like this:
1. Sam Harris => S.H
1. Patrick Feeney => P.F
  ## Ex11
  [MakeUpperCase <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/MakeUpperCase.go)
  > Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase.
## Ex12
  [You Can't Code Under Pressure #1 <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/YouCan'tCodeUnderPressure%231.go)
  > Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.
  ## Ex13
  [Get Nth Even Number <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/GetNthEvenNumber.go)
  > Return the Nth Even Number
> Example(Input --> Output)
 1. 1 --> 0 (the first even number is 0)
1. 3 --> 4 (the 3rd even number is 4 (0, 2, 4))
1. 100 --> 198
1. 1298734 --> 2597466
  ## Ex14
  [DNA to RNA Conversion <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/DNAtoRNAConversion.go)
  > Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').
> Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').
  > Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
> For example:
1. "GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
> The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of **'G'**, **'C'**, **'A'** and/or **'T'**.
  ## Ex15
  [Grasshopper - Terminal game move function <8kyu>](https://github.com/hoangyen-2103/CodeWar-Golang/blob/main/Grasshopper-TerminalGameMoveFunction.go)
  > Terminal game move function
> In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the die and moves the number of spaces indicated by the die two times.
> Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
> Example:
1. move(3, 6) should equal 15
